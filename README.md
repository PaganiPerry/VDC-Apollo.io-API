## Installation

GitHub should allow you to access, in the main branch, an option to "Open in Colab"


## Usage

Since this is an API, this is being used in conjunction with Apollo.io, thus it'll be important to remember to check in on rate limits. 

## Contributing

In order for this code to work, since you'll be connecting/mounting/sharing to Google Drive, you'll need to update ceratin lines of the code, since you'll now be the "creator/owner" of the code.

The reason it is the way it is is because the way I have the following folders and files set up goes as so: 
1. Shared folder called "VDC Engineering Contacts List" in My Drive (when I say my drive, I literally mean what Google Drive refers to as "My Drive" and not my actual Google Drive", so going forward I will make sure to differentiate them in the explanation).
2. Within the VDC Engineering Contacts List folder, I have document (which is just how Colab created it, but it can be opened as a Sheets file) called Test Engineer Contacts List V1.csv
